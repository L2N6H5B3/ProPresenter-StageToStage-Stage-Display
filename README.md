# StageToStage for ProPresenter 6

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/L2N6H5B3/StageToStage/master/Stage-To-Stage.png)

## StageToStage
StageToStage is a little Java-based app that I wrote to pull in the Stage Display data from ProPresenter and display current and next lyric slides, along with the stage display message, Video Counter, and Clock.


## Configuration and Use
config.txt stores all configuration information relating to the app.  Use config.txt to configure the IP/Hostname, ports, and passwords to use with StageToStage.
**Quick-Exit:** To quick-exit the app, use "Q" on your keyboard while the app is in focus


## Upcoming Features
Some of the features that I'm working on for the future are:
* Live Slide Image support (via Base64 encoded images)
* Custom Layout Support (Either from ProPresenter itself or via text file)
* Support for Windowed mode (with auto-resizing elements)
* Auto IP scan mode (with specific pre-set port)
* GUI for changing settings (via tray icon or button)
